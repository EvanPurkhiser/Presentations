### Evan Purkhiser's presentations

These are my slides for various presentations that I have given. These mostly
have to do with various school projects, but in the future perhapse I could give
some talks somewhere? Maybe, we'll see.

Anyway, find the presentations at this URL: http://evanpurkhiser.com/Presentations/

The presentations are powered by Hakim El Hattab's wonderful
[Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) presentation framework.

### Adding presentations

presentations are written using markdown and are stored in the `presentations`
directory. Each slide is separated by two blank lines.

An entry should be added to the `index.html` for each presentation.
