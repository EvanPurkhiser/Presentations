Software is much like a human being, it **will** age over time


# Why?


## Two reasons...

 1. Decaying source code (Lack of movement)
 2. Poorly understood source code changes (Ignorant surgery)


After many such changes, the original designers no longer understand the
product. Those who made the changes never did. In other words, _nobody
understand the modified product_

### Software Aging `!=` Software buggy-ness

However, the software buggy-ness may be due in part to the poorly understood
changes made to the software
