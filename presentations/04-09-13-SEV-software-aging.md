Software is much like a human being, it **will** age over time


# Why?


## Two reasons...

 1. Decaying source code / product (Lack of movement)
 2. Poorly understood source code changes (Ignorant surgery)


After many such changes, the original designers no longer understand the
product. Those who made the changes never did. In other words, _nobody
understand the modified product_

### Software Aging `!=` Software buggy-ness

However, the software buggy-ness may be due in part to the poorly understood
changes made to the software


# What happens?


## Three main things


## 1
### Software gets fat

Too keep up with demand for new features, code is piled into the project without
any thought or planning

Each new feature takes longer and longer and customers quickly lose interest in
the product


## 2
### Performance hits

Customers must upgrade their computers to achieve acceptable response times


## 3
### Loss in reliability

Errors will be introduced

Attempting to fix the errors will just result in more errors
